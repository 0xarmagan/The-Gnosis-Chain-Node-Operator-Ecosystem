# The Gnosis Chain Node Operator Ecosystem

The Gnosis Chain ecosystem offers diverse opportunities for individuals to participate in the staking economy as node operators. 

This comprehensive guide explores various protocols and projects where you can contribute while building your own sustainable on-chain income flow.

**Main goal**: **Establish your self sufficient on chain economy by becoming a node operator across multiple protocols within the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.**

Projects

## Gnosis Chain

Gnosis Chain is a community-owned EVM-based network operated by a diverse set of validators around the world. Gnosis Chain focused on resilience and credible neutrality as its core values. Currently, there are over 300,000 validators who secure the network.

### Why should I run a Gnosis Chain node?

You can become a validator with just 1 GNO. It shares the same architecture as Ethereum Beacon Chain, which enables easy implementation of all important EIPs. It activated the Dencun upgrade 2 days before Ethereum. Client diversity is expanding, with Geth and Reth to be included soon. Currently, you can use Erigon, Nethermind, Lodestar, Teku, Nimbus, and Lighthouse. With the Gnosis 3.0 vision, payment solutions and consumer-facing applications are being developed, all operating on Gnosis Chain.

## HOPR 

HOPR is a privacy-preserving messaging protocol and decentralized network that incentivizes users to protect privacy through a mixnet, rewarding them with HOPR tokens. It allows for the transmission of data without revealing metadata, ensuring true privacy in web3 applications.

### Why should I run a HOPR node?

HOPR will pioneer the development of GnosisVPN, a truly private and decentralized VPN on top of the HOPR mixnet. GnosisVPN routes data through the underlying HOPR network. The traffic is sent through changing routes via multiple HOPR nodes which makes it impossible for the recipient or third parties to reliably figure out where the data originated. 

### What do I need?

* Hardware
    * Dual-Core CPU or 2vCPU 
    * 2GB of RAM 
    * at least 5GB of disk space
* Software: [The Staking Hub](https://docs.hoprnet.org/node/staking-hub)

* Rewards: The expected average additional APR for a node runner is between 10-15%

## Swarm 

Swarm is a decentralised storage and communication system. Its incentive system is enforced through smart contracts on the Gnosis Chain blockchain and powered by the xBZZ token, making it economically self-sustaining.


### Why should I run a Swarm node?


Swarm provides the fundamental blockchain components of storage and messaging layers. They have dapps running natively on Gnosis Chain, and becoming a node operator is very straightforward. It has Dappnode integration. It has many use cases including AI, NFTs, decentralized data and content storage, and data ownership. Operating a node comes with relatively low costs.

### What do I need? 

* Hardware
    * Light and UltraLight Nodes: The minimum required hardware specifications for light and ultralight nodes are very low, and can be run on practically any commercially available computer or microcomputer such as a Raspberry Pi.
    * Full Node
        * Dual core, recent generation 
        * 2ghz processor 8gb RAM 
        * 30gb SSD 
        * Stable internet connection

* Reward: The Swarm network includes two incentives protocols which each give Bee nodes incentives to participate in maintaining the network in a healthy way. More details here.

## Autonolas / Pearl

Olas enables everyone to own a share of AI, specifically autonomous agent economies. They  incentivizes and coordinates different parties to launch autonomous agents that form entire AI economies.

### Why should I run a AI Agent?

With Olas's AI agent framework, you can create Sovereign Agents. For example, you can create AI trading bots for prediction markets or AI Agents specialized in DeFi. Alternatively, you can use existing bots on OLAS. The AI Agent economy is a rapidly growing and evolving field. You can start running nodes with the Pearl application that runs natively on Gnosis Chain.

### What do I need? 

* Software
    * [Download Pearl](https://olas.network/operate)
* Hardware
    * 800 MB of free RAM (suggested 1 GB)
    * 1.3 GB disk space

* Rewards: Earn OLAS by staking OLAS and running agents on your computer.

## Shutter Network

The Shutter Protocol employs threshold encryption to shield transactions. Participating validators on the Gnosis Chain commit to including these encrypted transactions, making it virtually impossible for front-runners to interfere.

### Why should I run a Shutter validator?

Participating validators on the Gnosis Chain commit to including these encrypted transactions, making it virtually impossible for front-runners to interfere. This level of protection ensures that end-users are shielded from financial losses and market manipulation, maintaining the integrity of the decentralized system.

### What do I need?

* Hardware/Software: You can participate by running Gnosis Chain Node.

## Stakewise v3 Vault

StakeWise V3 enables you to launch your own staking environment, called Vault, and keep the stake in the Vault liquid with osETH, a liquid staking token of StakeWise. A Vault is a customizable smart contract that can be deployed by anyone to stake their own capital and/or offer staking to others, all in a non-custodial way.

### Why should I run a vault on Stakewise?

You can launch a vault and earn fee rewards in addition to consensus rewards. Furthermore, you contribute to the decentralization of Stakewise.

### What do I need?  

* You can participate by running Gnosis Chain validator.

## Obol Network

Obol Labs is a research and software development team focused on proof-of-stake infrastructure for public blockchain networks. Specific topics of focus are Internet Bonds, Distributed Validator Technology and Multi-Operator Validation.

* [The Distributed Validator Launchpad](https://gnosischain.launchpad.obol.org/), a user interface for bootstrapping Distributed Validators; 
* [Charon](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon/releases/tag/v1.1.1), a middleware client that enables validators to run in a fault-tolerant, distributed manner; 
* [Obol Splits](https://docs.obol.org/docs/sc/introducing-obol-splits), a set of solidity smart contracts for the distribution of rewards from Distributed Validators; 

### Why should I run a Obol's Charon node?

As highlighted by [Vitalik Buterin](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/20/futures3.html), Obol's approach to distributed validation represents a significant evolution in staking infrastructure. The M-of-N format allows multiple participants to stake together, reducing individual operational burden while maintaining security. This becomes increasingly valuable as developments in statelessness and L1 EVM validity proofs reduce node operation overhead. It's a forward-thinking solution that makes solo staking more accessible and sustainable for the future of blockchain validation.
